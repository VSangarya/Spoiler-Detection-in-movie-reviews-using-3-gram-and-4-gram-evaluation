# Spoiler-Detection-in-movie-reviews-using-3-gram-and-4-gram-evaluation
This is a simple movie spoiler detection in reviews. It uses the main synposis/plot from wikipedia of each movie and compares it with the review we give as input.<br/>
It processes botht the documents and checks the 3gram and 4gram similarity. Based on the calculated output, the movie review is classified as having spoilers or not.<br/>

Note : It's primarily designed for large movie reviews with multiple spoilers.<br/>
I've added some sample reviews of Avengers:Endgame (some of which contain spoilers and some don't) for testing purposes<br/>
